Objective:

The goal is to run a series of jobs in the shortest time possible.
There are 10 jobs to be executed - job1, job2, job3, ... job10. Write a script
that runs these jobs. For the purpose of the script, assume that the
binaries named job1, job2, ... job10 exist in te path. Note the dependencies
below. If one job depends on another, it must not be executed until that
job finishes.

Dependencies:

1.  All other jobs depend on job1 to be complete.
2.  job3, job4,.... job10 depend on job2 as well.
3.  job6 depends on job4 and job5.
4.  job10 depends on all other jobs.

Notes:

1.  The script must exit with error status if any job fails.
2.  If one job fails, then the other jobs that are dependent on it must not be
    executed.
3.  Any scripting language can be used for this.
4.  If you want to write a Jenkins pipeline or ansible script as well, that is
    good.
